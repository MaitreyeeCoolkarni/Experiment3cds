This is a code to learn about diffrent operators like ==,<=,>,< and more general operators in c++

First code takes an entry from the user

Then checks if number is greater than 0

If that is the case its positive(We use the > operator)

If its zero it returns zero(check using == operator)

Else it returns NEGATIVE

Second code also takes entry from the user

Then using if and else checks if the average of the inputs is equal to any if else conditions

input is commpared to the if-else conditions using operators

If the avg lies above 90

A grade is given

And similar to this grade is giving based on what average is obtained

Third code also takes input for x and y coordinate

If x>0 and y>0 the point lies in first quadrant

If x<0 and y<0 it lies in third quadrant

And such conditions are given
