AIM-To learn about diffrent relational operators like <,>,==,!= 

APPARATUS-VS CODE/Programiz

ALGORITHM:
(For Coordinates code):

Declare two integer variables for x and y coordinates.

Prompt and store user input for x coordinate.

Prompt and store user input for y coordinate.

Output the position of point (x, y) based on its coordinates (origin, x-axis, y-axis, or one of four quadrants).

PROGRAM 2:
(For grades program)
Declare three integer variables for physics, maths, and biology marks.

Prompt and store user input for maths marks.

Prompt and store user input for physics marks.

Prompt and store user input for biology marks.

Calculate the average of the three marks.

Output the average marks.

Output the grade based on the average (O, A+, A, B, C, or Fail).

Program 3:
(For Even and Odd)

Declare an integer variable for a number.

Prompt and store user input for the number.

Output whether the number is positive, negative, or zero based on its value.

THEORY:
In C++, relational operators are used to compare two values or expressions, returning a boolean result (true or false) based on the relationship between them. They are commonly used in conditional statements (e.g., if, while) to evaluate conditions.

Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
Example: 5 == 5 returns true.

Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
Example: 5 != 3 returns true.

Greater than (>): Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
Example: 5 > 3 returns true.

Less than (<): Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
Example: 3 < 5 returns true.

Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
Example: 5 >= 5 returns true.

Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.
Example: 3 <= 5 returns true.

Conclusion:Relational operators allow the program to have multiple conditions which can help us write the program
