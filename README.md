## Algorithm

### Program 1 – Coordinates

1. Declare two integer variables for x and y coordinates  
2. Prompt and store user input for x coordinate  
3. Prompt and store user input for y coordinate  
4. Output the position of the point `(x, y)` based on its coordinates:
   - Origin
   - On x-axis
   - On y-axis
   - In one of the four quadrants

### Program 2 – Grade Evaluation

1. Declare three integer variables for marks in Physics, Maths, and Biology  
2. Prompt and store user input for each subject  
3. Calculate the average of the three marks  
4. Output the average  
5. Output the grade based on the average:  
   - O, A+, A, B, C, or Fail

### Program 3 – Even and Odd Classification

1. Declare an integer variable  
2. Prompt and store user input  
3. Output whether the number is:
   - Positive  
   - Negative  
   - Zero

## Theory

In C++, relational operators are used to compare two values or expressions and return a boolean result: `true` (1) or `false` (0). They are essential in control flow statements such as `if`, `while`, and `for`.

### Common Relational Operators

- `==` (Equal to): Returns `true` if both values are equal  
  Example: `5 == 5` → `true`

- `!=` (Not equal to): Returns `true` if values are not equal  
  Example: `5 != 3` → `true`

- `>` (Greater than): Returns `true` if the left value is greater  
  Example: `5 > 3` → `true`

- `<` (Less than): Returns `true` if the left value is smaller  
  Example: `3 < 5` → `true`

- `>=` (Greater than or equal to): Returns `true` if left is greater or equal  
  Example: `5 >= 5` → `true`

- `<=` (Less than or equal to): Returns `true` if left is smaller or equal  
  Example: `3 <= 5` → `true`

## Conclusion

Relational operators enable comparison between values and play a crucial role in decision-making within a program. By using these operators, we can control program flow and create flexible, condition-based logic.
